## Predicting Baseball Players’ Value through Machine Learning: Traditional Metrics vs Advanced Metrics
### Project Overview
#### This project aims to predict the Annual Average Value (AAV) of Major League Baseball (MLB) player contracts using machine learning techniques. The study compares the effectiveness of traditional metrics versus advanced metrics in creating accurate predictive models. The repository includes all necessary databases, MySQL queries, and Jupyter notebooks used for model building and analysis.
