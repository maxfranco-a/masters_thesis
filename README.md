## Predicting Baseball Playersâ€™ Value through Machine Learning: Traditional Metrics vs Advanced Metrics
### Project Overview
#### This project aims to predict the Annual Average Value (AAV) of Major League Baseball (MLB) player contracts using machine learning techniques. The study compares the effectiveness of traditional metrics versus advanced metrics in creating accurate predictive models. The repository includes all necessary databases, MySQL queries, and Jupyter notebooks used for model building and analysis.
### Repository Structure
#### The repository is organized as follows:
### Pitching

#### Adv
- **Dataframes/**: Contains dataframes used in advanced pitching analysis.
- **Python Notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for building and evaluating machine learning models using advanced pitching metrics.
- **queries/**: SQL queries used for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes related to advanced pitching metrics.

#### Trad
- **Dataframes/**: Contains dataframes used in traditional pitching analysis.
- **Python Notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for building and evaluating machine learning models using traditional pitching metrics.
- **queries/**: SQL queries used for ETL processes related to traditional pitching metrics.

### Batting
- **Python Codes/**: Python scripts for data processing, model building, and evaluation for batting metrics.
- **queries/**: SQL queries used for ETL processes related to batting metrics.
- **R codes/**: R scripts for statistical analysis and model building for batting metrics.
- **tables/**: Contains tables and datasets used in batting analysis.

### Initial Tables
####all tables for traditional metrics and salaries

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- MySQL Workbench
- SQLite
- R and RStudio (for R codes)
